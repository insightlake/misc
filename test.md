### Key Insights:
- **Apache Spark** is versatile, supporting both batch and streaming data, but it processes streams as micro-batches, which can introduce slight delays.
- **Kafka Streams (KStream)** is best suited for Kafka-centric environments and is optimized for simple to moderately complex streaming tasks directly over Kafka topics.
- **Apache Flink** excels in scenarios requiring robust, true real-time processing capabilities and comprehensive state management.

This table helps delineate the frameworks based on technical specifications and use case fit, making it easier to decide which framework might be best suited for specific data processing tasks.
